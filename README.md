Monte Carlo Class Project
Project Overview
This project simulates the spread and removal of a computer virus within a network of 20 computers. The simulation utilizes the Monte Carlo method to estimate:

Infection time: The average time it takes for a virus to infect a network.
Probability of infection: The likelihood that a computer will be infected within a given time frame.
Expected infections: The number of computers expected to be infected under certain conditions.

Features
Monte Carlo Simulation: Randomized trials simulate virus behavior over multiple iterations.
Adjustable Parameters: Probability of infection per computer, infection duration, and removal rates can be customized.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required libraries:
numpy
matplotlib for data visualization

Results
The simulation outputs:

Average infection time across multiple runs.
Probability of infection per computer.
A summary table showing infection trends over the simulation.
